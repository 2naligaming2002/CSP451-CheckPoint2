# Collaboration Workflow Report

This project followed a GitHub-based collaboration workflow to simulate
a team development environment. Each feature was planned using GitHub
Issues, with one issue created per feature branch. Feature branches were
created from the main branch and used to implement changes independently.

Pull Requests were opened for each feature branch and linked to their
corresponding issues using the "Closes #X" syntax. Code review was
simulated by adding review comments directly on the Pull Request, since
GitHub does not allow users to approve or request changes on their own
pull requests in solo repositories.

A merge conflict was intentionally created by modifying the same file in
multiple branches. The conflict was resolved manually, committed, and
pushed to the main branch. All Pull Requests were merged using the
"squash and merge" method to maintain a clean commit history.

This workflow demonstrates proper use of issues, branches, pull
requests, reviews, conflict resolution, and merge strategies in a
collaborative GitHub environment.
